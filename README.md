# CodeClassroom Video-Editor-Classroom SPA application
The pandemic has been a challenge for all of us and since we didn’t get to meet our friends like the pre-covid days, we devised new ways of keeping contact with them. Being a coder, what’s better than having coding sessions with our friends/peers/random folks alongside chatting, talking and even sharing our screens to resolve each others' doubts, all on a single platform.
</br>

Not Only this there are platforms that allows multiple users to create a meeting, voice/video calling and join the conversation to discuss any topics.
The problem with these platforms that users who enter the conversation late are not able to catch up what's going on.
